      <b>You are being asked to participate in a research study.</b> Scientists do research to answer important questions that might help change or improve the way we do things in the future. This document will give you information about the study to help you decide whether you want to participate. Please read this form, and ask any questions you have, before agreeing to be in the study.
</br></br><b>All research is voluntary.</b> You can choose not to take part in this study. If you decide to participate, you can change your mind later and leave the study at any time. You will not be penalized or lose any benefits if you decide not to participate or choose to leave the study later.
</br></br><b>This research is intended for individual 18 years of age or older. If you are under age 18, do not complete the survey.</b>
</br></br><b>The purpose of this study</b> is to help scientists better understand how people learn to solve cognitive problems. 
</br>We are asking you if you want to be in this study because you are a member of the Indiana University Psychology Department Subject Pool. The study is being conducted by Emily Fyfe, Associate Professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Indiana University.
</br></br><b>If you agree to be in the study, you will do the following things.</b> 
You will be presented with several straightforward tasks to complete on a device of your choice. These tasks will involve solving cognitive problems such as reasoning with images, words, letters, numbers, etc. You may also provide responses to survey questions about your attitudes and experiences about learning and background information. Participants in this study may complete slightly different variations of the same tasks. The session typically ends within 60 minutes. You may complete the experiment at a location of your choice.

</br></br><b>Before agreeing to participate, please consider the risks and potential benefits of taking part in this study.</b>The risks of participating in this research are a potential risk of loss of confidentiality. This risk is minimized by the investigator, as outlined in the section below.

</br>We don't expect you to receive any benefit from taking part in this study, but we hope to learn things which will help scientists in the future.

</br></br><b>You will be paid for participating in this study.</b>Alternatively, you will receive 0.5 credits for each 30 minutes you participate for Psychology 101, 102, or 155. Withdrawal prior to the completion of the study will result in no penalty or loss of benefits. If you decide not to participate, you can earn the same credit alternatively by other types of assignments designated by your course instructor. 

</br></br><b>We will protect your information</b> and make every effort to keep your personal information confidential, but we cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality. No information which could identify you will be shared in publications about this study. If you participated in person and the session was audiotaped, the audio recordings will be stored in a password protected server of the Psychology department with any identifiable information removed. Only our research team will have access to the recordings. 

</br>Your personal information may be shared outside the research study if required by law. We also may need to share your research records with other groups for quality assurance or data analysis. These groups include the Indiana University Institutional Review Board or its designees, and state or federal agencies who may need to access the research records (as allowed by law).

</br></br><b>If you have questions about the study or encounter a problem with the research,</b> contact the researcher, Emily Fyfe, at 812-856-6856 or efyfe@iu.edu.
